# Personalised coaching - How it works? 


**Welcome** to our personalized coaching program - an opportunity to **accelerate your success**. Discover how it works in less than 3 minutes.

### Getting Started

At our company, we prioritize individuals and interactions over processes and tools, aligning with the agile manifesto. If this resonates with you, we invite you to take the first step by scheduling an introductory session with one of our lead coaches. You can easily **[book the session here](https://docusaurus.new)**, and the best part is, it's on us - **completely free of charge**. With a wealth of experience conducting hundreds of interviews at top-tier companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and more, our **[coaches](https://techinterview.coach/coaches)** are equipped to swiftly identify your blind spots and assist you in developing a tailored plan that highlights your strengths.

### What do you need?
To get started, allocate 15-30 minutes of your undivided attention, ensure a stable internet connection, and have your laptop ready. Most importantly, be open and forthcoming during the introductory session. We are here to provide support, and judgment has no place in our vocabulary. Feel free to share your thoughts and concerns.

### What's next?
During the call, your coach will gather key inputs from you, including the time frame until your next interview, the areas you wish to focus on, any blind spots you've identified, as well as your current career and preparation levels.

### What happens after that?
The ball is in your court! Based on the information you provide, your coach will propose and share with you during the call **a personalised action plan**
- **S**imple
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**ealistic
- **T**imebounded

### FAQs

**What if I don't want to book a follow-up session?**

It's perfectly fine! If you simply needed a sounding board, you can choose to follow the plan independently. You can also checkout some of our articles on technical and behavioural preparation - they will always be free. However, if you require further support, you have the option to book one or more 1-hour coaching sessions at a rate of -$75 per hour. Your coach will guide you through the booking process. We intentionally refrain from advertising this functionality here because we genuinely believe in the value of personal interactions and strongly recommend connecting with one of our coaches first. 

**Nothing is for free. What's the cost for me?**

The intro session and ALL articles on our blog will forever be free. We value your trust, this is the least we can do to help and it costs us almost nothing. By default we do charge $80/hour and we may from time to time run discounts on multiple sessions. We also provide **an intensive coaching plan** which we do not charge unless you pass your interview. However, we do reserve the right to chose candidates whom we believe can successfully enroll into the programme.
